## Introduction
**Born 2 Be Root** is a project made to develop the skills of **VM** (**V**irtual **M**achine) or Server creation and maintainence.
This is Skill Set useful for example when you need to have a mini machine to run code continously with or without supervision where it can cause no major harm.

The Subject Documentation goes as follows:
> You will create your first machine in `VirtualBox` (or `UTM` if you can't use `VirtualBox`)
> under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up
> your own operating system while implementing strict rules.
>
> * The use of `VirtualBox` (or `UTM` if you can't use `VirtualBox`) is mandatory.
>
> * You only have to turn in a `signature.txt` file at the root of your repository.
> You must paste in it the signature of your machineâ€™s virtual disk.
> Go to [Submission](../submission/Index.md) for more information.
