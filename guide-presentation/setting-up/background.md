### Headless Machines
In Computing (Hardware), the head of a machine refers to the Display Monitor.  
When a machine has a monitor connected and its an active display, the device is considered to have a 'Head'

Likewise with a machine that is able to run without any graphical interface,
it is considered that the machine can run in 'Headless mode'.  
A Headless machine runs all the same with a monitor and without.
