When Booting up the VM after the ***Creation*** stage you will be greeted with the  
`Debian GNU/Linux installer menu (BIOS mode)`  
Because we are not using a monitor based machine, select `Install`. Select your mandatory **Lanugage**, then select your **Timezone**.  
With selecting your keyboard, if you are not sure about the language type check with your [Country's Keyboard Layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout "Wikipedia Keyboard layout").

The Subject requires you to have your hostname as `<intra-username>42`.
It is recommened to leave the **Domain Name** blank as the machine will auto generate a domain name.
