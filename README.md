## Introduction
[Back To Top](#born-2-be-root)

**Born 2 Be Root** is a project made to develop the skills of VM or Server creation and maintainence.
This is Skill Set useful for example when you need to have a mini machine to run code continously with or without supervision where it can cause no major harm.


## Creation
[Back To Top](#born-2-be-root)

To get Started open `Virtual Box` by Oracle. Click on _New_ and name your machine.
When selecting Type use the `Linux` with the `Debian` option as that is the OS this guide is made for.
Leave the memory at `1024 MG` (`1GB`).

When creating the "Drive", make a `VDI` (Virtual Disk Image) that is Dynamically allocated.
A very important step of the creation of the drive is to
make sure you save it in a place that can store the amount of storage set (which is recommended to be a minimum of 12GB).

Currently a known place is the `goinfre` subdirectory linked on the users home dir (`~/`) as noted by 42 Adelaide.

After the creation of the drive you are ready to install [**Debian**](<DEBIAN-Downloads.md>).
When downloading Debian, it is good practice to keep the "Image (ISO)" in the same folder and the "Drive (VDI)".
Assuming that you have downloaded a Debian Image you can now attach it to the VM.

Enter the VMs **Settings** and navigate to **Storage**
